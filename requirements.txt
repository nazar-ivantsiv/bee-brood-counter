# Bee Brood Counter - Density Estimation Requirements
# Minimal dependencies for density map approach

# Core ML framework
tensorflow>=2.15.0,<2.16.0
# Note: For Apple Silicon M1/M2 Macs, use:
# tensorflow-macos==2.15.0
# tensorflow-metal==1.1.0

# Image processing
opencv-python>=4.8.0
numpy>=1.23.0,<2.0.0  # TensorFlow 2.15 requires numpy<2.0

# Scientific computing (for Gaussian density maps)
scipy>=1.11.0

# That's it! Only 4 dependencies needed for production use.

# Optional: Development tools (uncomment if needed)
# jupyter>=1.0.0              # For interactive development
# matplotlib>=3.7.0           # For visualization during training
# tensorboard>=2.15.0         # For training monitoring
